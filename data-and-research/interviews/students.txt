For these interviews, I used a semi-structured format balancing guided questions with open-ended exploration to allow for unanticipated insights. I interviewed 5 students to get a view of what they like and what could be improved to help them learn. For each interview, instead of writing full transcripts, I took notes of the most important parts. Each interview, before asking the questions I would explain to them my example workflow for the application.
